                Our story begins in 2010 with a simple idea from our founder that the most comfortable place to work is anywhere, because ideas are not limited by space and time, and the most comfortable place is in a caf√© where their favorite coffee is available.

                All the best local coffee been varieties from throughout Indonesia are available with us. Directly from selected farmers, high-quality beans are processed and roasted to perfection by ourselves, then passed on to our skilled baristas who are passionate about preparing a cup of longed-for happiness from home.
